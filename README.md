# MPC / FORCE NodeJs App

This App will will be installed on the root of of your internal sd card un .apps directory and required nodejs to be installed too.

# Purpose

The primary purpose is to laydown a basic primary framework for rapid app development of any kind the user may desire in javascript/Node Js.
The apps build into this are mainly my use cases but can help understand how things are laid out and how you can build your own if you so desire.

**Basically:**

1. Define Endpoints in /api/ENDPONTS.js for backend handlers
2. Copy your Client code to /assets/ (css/js .. ).
3. [The Prog Bulilder source code](https://github.com/intelliriffer/mpc-node-app/blob/master/.apps/api/endpoints/pbuilder.js) is more or less a complete example of how you would go about injecting client scripts and rendering partial templates etc to build together a bit more involved app.
